    <para>
      There are two types of state in Gthree, regular data, and GL resources.
    </para>

    <para>
      Regular data is things like the object in the scene, their positions
      and relations, but also host side geometry data like the vertex
      position and colors as well as the pixbuf data for textures. Another
      form is GLSL code (in textual form).
    </para>

    <para>
      GL resources are something that are tied to the OpenGL context, and
      any time such contents is manipulated or referenced the GL context
      must be active. GL resources are of several types: buffers
      (i.e. geometry data), textures, programs.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is particularly sensitive when it comes to destroying state, such
      as when finalizing a widget, or even more so when moving between different
      GL contexts (such as when a widget moves to a new toplevel window). The main
      problem here is that finalization can be arbitrary delayed by a reference
      being held somewhere, and by the time we're finalizing we may no longer
      have access to the GL context.
    </para>

    <para>
      GL resources are transient and generated from regular data when
      needed. As such it can be destroyed and recreated as needed. This is
      called realization/unrealization. For example, to realize a texture
      means allocating a gl texture id for it and uploading the data, and
      unrealizing it means freeing the data and deleting the id.
    </para>

    <refsect2 id="resources-data-ownership">
      <title>Data Ownership</title>

      <para>
        The toplevel owner of data is the #GThreeArea widget. It owns the
        scene, as well as as camera object (which is typically also part of
        the scenen. It also has a renderer object, but only while the widget
        is realized. A more complex program might have multiple scenes and/or
        cameras, but only one renderer per GL context, because the renderer
        keeps track of the GL state and would be confused if something else
        re-used the context.
      </para>

      <para>
        The scene contains both regular data and GL state. For example, it
        indirectly references vertex arrays and textures, which are created
        and uploaded to the GPU on when needed. This means a scene can only be
        used by one GL context at a time. However, by unrealizing and then
        re-realizing the resources it can be switched to a different context.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2 id="resources-realization">
      <title>Realization</title>

      <para>
        The fact that some object store both regular data and GPU resources
        makes it lifetime management somewhat complicated. Take for example a
        scene. You can dynamically add objects to a scene either before or
        after it is displayed without problem, because this just adds regular
        data. The data can then be realized as needed during rendering, when
        we're guaranteed to have an active GL context. However, if you remove
        an object (to free it or add it back later), or move it to another
        scene, then there is no guarantee that the the corresponding GL
        context is active, so you can't directly unrealize it.
      </para>

      <para>
        All objects that may hold GL resources are of the type
        GthreeResource<footnote><para>Actually programs are not, but all
        programs are owned by the renderer which is tied to realization of
        the widget.</para></footnote>, and are realized for one single GL
        Context at a time (or are unrealized and independent). You can
        call gthree_resources_unrealize_all_for() to unrealize all the
        resources for a Context, but this is typically done automatically
        when unrealizing the GthreeArea widget that owns the Context.
      </para>

      <para>
        The only points we can guarantee that the GL context is active is
        during rendering, widget realization and widget unrealization. This
        means all unrealization must be postponed until one of these points.
        For finalization at odd times (i.e. when the context is not active)
        this means it frees all the regular data, but keeps the GPU data
        around in an queue which is freed at the next oportune moment.
        Every time you render this queue is flushed, but you can also
        trigger it manually i needed by calling gthree_resources_unrealize_all_for().
      </para>

      <para>
        It is sometimes hard to track what resources are in use, and which you
        may want to allocate, but gthree has some simple mark-and-sweep system
        that lets you find it. You call gthree_resources_set_all_unused_for()
        on a context, then iterate over all important resources, calling
        gthree_resource_set_used (). Then you can call gthree_resources_unrealize_unused_for()
        to unrealize all resources that are still realize but not actually
        in use.
